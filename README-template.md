### What I learned
        Well, I learnth alot from working on this project even though I have been having a little problem on styling the backgroung colour of my Qr Code.
        I length how to use the margin-left, right and top to move my Qr code to the center of my webpage. learnt how to change the front-size, color of my texts and finially learnt how to add a shadow behind my Qr code which till now gives me the chills....ðŸ¥¶


```css
body {
   border-radius: 20px;
    margin-left: 500px;
    margin-top: 50px;
     box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}

h1{
     font-size: 20px;
}
```

### Continued development
I focuse more on my webdevelopmet, even though its been long since i visited it, but with this projects i might just be able to get back on track.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.coursera.org/) - This helped me for my foundations in how to use html and css effectively. I really liked their pattern of teaching and will use it going forward.
